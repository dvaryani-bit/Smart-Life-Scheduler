# SmartScheduler
An app that keeps track and optimizes your day's schedule so that you can achieve more productivity from your day.

This project was part of an advanced OOP class and currently has basic functionality such as keeping track of your calendar events, wake-time, sleep-time and water intake.

There are many well developed applications in the market which achieve the similar goal that this project is aimed towards; however, the biggest limitation to them is that the data input is manual and static. What if someone wakes up an hour later or does not input their water intake on the app?

In order to develop this project into a product, the first goal is to automate data inputs such as wake/sleep time and water intake. Wake/sleep times can be automated with apple watch integration and I am exploring methods to automate water intake data.
