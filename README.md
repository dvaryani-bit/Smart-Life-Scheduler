# SmartScheduler
An app that keep's track and optimizes your day's schedule so that you can achieve more productivity from your day.

This project was part of an advanced OOP class and currently has basic functionality such as keeping track of your calendar events, wake-time, sleep-time and water intake.

There are many well developed applications in the market which achieve the similar goal that this project is aimed towards; however, the biggest limitation to them is that the data input is manual and static. What if someone wakes up an hour later or does not input their water intake?

The goal to develop this into a product is if there are automated ways to detect wake/sleep times and water intake. Wake/sleep times can be automated with apple watch integration; however, new methods need to be explored to automate water intake data.
